### Usage
- Up and down arrows let you navigate through the history of executed commands.
- Tab button allows you to autocomplete arguments depending on the command line tool your using. It can only autocomplete when what you've written so far unambiguously matches something (e.g. a file name or folder name). If there are multiple possibilities that share a prefix matching what you've written, it will not autocomplete; if you press the tab button twice, it will list the available options.
- The 'clear' command clears your screen of contents.
- 'ctrl-c' will force close a running command line tool. Use it when you need to stop something.

### Aliases

- '..' stands for the parent of the folder you are currently inside
