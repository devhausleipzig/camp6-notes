Branches are alternative histories. You can duplicate it and make changes on one that aren't reflected on the other.

Every commit has it's own pointer to the commits it came from 

a branch is a pointer you can move around
commits are a fixed element 

git branch -- see local branches
git branch -a -- shows hidden branches as well
git checkout -- switching branches
git checkout -b -- fastest way to create a branch and name it 
git fetch - updates remote server with local
git pull -- take from online 
git push -- upload on line 
git init -- create a new repository 
ls .git -- search for what git projects there are 
git log -- a graph of all the commits in current branch 
git status -- 
git commit -m "message" -- comitting git before push
git clone (url)
git add . -- to stage 
git clone (ssh) - 
nano -- built in text editor
:wq get tf out of vim 

to commit before pushing, git commit -m “[descriptive message]”

git branch (name)
git checkout -b (name) - fastest way to create a branch and name it 




mind mapping techniques:

GRINDE map - grouped reflective interconnected nonverbal directional emphasized 
blooms taxonomy

clone repository  somewhere convneient
open vault in obsidian sing that folder
command line, create new branch "Suzy"
any change made to notes do it on personal branch
