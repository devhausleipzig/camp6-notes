## OS Landscape
- embedded software such as BIOS
- OS works on top of that
- Embedded OS and IoT: linux or android most popular
- Dektop: Windows 70%, OS X 20%, Linux 2%
- Android: 75%, IOS 25%
- two distinctions in OS: not Unix-based (primarily Windows) and Unix-based (OS X, IOS, Android, Linux) 
- Kernel: core software built unto the hardware that in turn enables software to run
- Software (including OS) can make system call to Kernel to use hardware
- OS is Kernel plus software and tools to be more accessible and user-friendly
- differences between OS: GUI; Shell; Tools; Services
- OS have their own (often multiple) frameworks for software and apps hence won't work on other OS
- Shells: modern Windows uses Powershell; Linux uses Bash; modern Mac uses ZShell
- Powershell is case-insensitive
- Bash and ZShell is case-sensitive
- Windows uses carriage return and line feed; Linux only recognizes line feed
- config: Windows uses registry; Unix uses multiple config files
