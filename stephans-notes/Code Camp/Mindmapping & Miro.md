# Mindmapping
- needs to be doen right to be effective

**Grinde**
	- grouped -> organize ideas and content in groups and categories
	- reflective -> notes should be reflection of what is going in your mind while learning/working
	- interconnected -> connect ideas and categories and keep looking and establishing new and more connections | isolated knowledge is forgettable
	- non-verbal -> use arrows, images, doodles, etc.
	- directional -> organizing ideas and categories in order and direction to visualize flow / cause & effect
	- emphasize -> reduce cognitive load of tehnique and make it easier to read mind map, recognize flow between ideas and let brain focus on content and connection

## Cognitive Load
- cognitive load theory
- #to-do
- check out the theory and take some notes
- reducing the load allows better learning but the load needs to reach a threshhold to affect learning
- no cognitive load = no engagement with learning material
