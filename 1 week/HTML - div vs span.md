## position relative
pr will allow div containers to be placed relative to the top left corner, according to
- defined units (left: ....px rems)
- document flow

## position absolute
position absolute will allow div containers to be placed outside the document flow, but still relative to the top left corner of the element that its nested inside, e.g. body or another div


## spans and divs:
main difference between divs and span: 
- divs assume properties of blocks beneath each other in the page, as they have a built in line break
- spans do not assume width and height attributes but instead adapt to the content inside
